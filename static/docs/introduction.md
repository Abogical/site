<h2>Why Jungle</h2>
Jungle was built to be <i>the</i> static site framework for <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>. It generates completely static code that doesn't have to be hydrated into a single page application, or SPA. If you're looking to build an SPA or a static site which hydrates to an SPA, check out <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev">Sapper</a>. However, Jungle was built to have some of the best features of Sapper while leverage tools which Sapper doesn't, such as:
<ul>
<li><b>A GraphQL data layer</b> - For simple data management querying, from any part of your app, using any data source</li>
<li><b>Dynamic routing</b> - Using [param].svelte files anywhere in src/routes lets you generate fully dynamic routes from your GraphQL data layer</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<h2>The Jamstack</h2>
By compiling down to a truly static site, Jungle takes advantage of better performance, easier scaling, and higher security. Write great, simple code that can build to a static site that can be hosted anywhere. Read more about the Jamstack <a href="https://jamstack.org/">here</a>.
