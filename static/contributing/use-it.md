Just using Jungle in your websites is a big help! The more people that use it the more support there is for this project, and the more it'll grow. Jungle is especially great for your blog or documentation site, but is also a great fit for any other static site. Check out the <a href="docs/quick-start/">quick start</a> to get started or see more options to contribute on the left.

P.S. Starring us on <a href="https://github.com/junglejs/junglejs">GitHub</a> is a great way to show us you're using Jungle!
