If you feel there is something missing (which there will likely be for a while - the web has many use cases) add <a href="https://github.com/junglejs/junglejs/issues">an issue to our repo</a>. Or, if you <i>just can't wait</i> and want to write the code yourself, you can submit a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/junglejs/junglejs">junglejs/junglejs repo</a>. There's no official style guide to code yet, but write clean, simple code and we'll accept it.
